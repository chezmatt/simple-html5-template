# Simple Clean HTML5 template
###About why I'm doing this...
In looking for a quick way to just throw the basics of a html5 page  using a simple sublime snippet, I found that all the templates, frameworks, boilerplates, and skeletons were too complicated. I didn't really want to import all this "stuff" i.e. CSS JS and the like, I wanted to do that myself, but wanted to save a little bit of time with an outline of html to get me started or a way to just mess around. So I wrote this template to do just that.
## Simple clean HTML 5
My goal is to keep this as simple as possible and easy to delete all the stuff you don't need or to at very least keep it turned off. 
## Modular
If you really want to load Bootstrap and normalize and all that stuff you can. you'll need to add the classes yourself.
## I'm not a big fan if divs..
I feel that there are too many class selectors ids and divs and that the code get more and more complex. It seems the goal with HTML5 is to simplify all the structure not make it more complicated. Do as much as you can using the tag elements in the CSS. Add divs and ids only when really needed.
## Consider a framework
I'm not a big fan of Bootstrap, I feel that it is too overused along with the tower page. Now I know this isn't trendy or hipster or what have you, but it's there if you need it. Look at Foundation, Skeleton, or html5 boilerplate as an alternative to the same old Bootstrap.
## Old browsers...
If you're using an old browser too bad, there's some effort to help the user along, but you can only lead them to water. If people are still using some wacky old browser, don't worry about it. Mobile friendly CSS, and ADA / Screen reader helpful code is more important. 
## Complaints, Comments, Querstions and Usage.
I plan to tweak this overtime and adapt it. This is just for some fun and inspiration. Ask questions, I'll write a FAQ and how to use eventually. Feel free to use this however you want! Nothing here is really original, it was inspired by HTML5 Boilerplate. Which I love but is too much for what I'm looking for,
